# AttentionApp

Silly app I made for my gf

Basically an attention button

On first launch it asks if its her or me

If its her, she can open the app at any time and theres a button to request attention. It can only be pressed once every 5 seconds to avoid me being spammed to death
When she presses it it sends me a notification and opens up a screen with flashing text telling me she wants attention, vibrating my phone and playing the alarm sound
That screen has a button I press to make it stop, which sends her a notification saying i acknowledged it (so I can't ignore her)

I used firebase for the backend stuff
